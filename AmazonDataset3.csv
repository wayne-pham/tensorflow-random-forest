0,The Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't by a more expensive one. Get this!,"  I literally (and I mean that in the actual definition of the word) just opened it up and set my portable monitor on it (Asus MB169+) and it works perfectly. I bought a couple other (more expensive) stands which were nice, but I didn't feel like they were sturdy enough for my monitor. This is one is very sturdy and folds up nicely for portability.",Verified Purchase,197 people found this helpful
1,DAOWAce,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's cheap, and garbage.","  Bought this to use with my Galaxy Tab A.If you're using it solely as a stand to watch and not interact with, it's fine.  Very cheap way to just use as a mini-TV basically.If you're actually interacting with the tablet, you're in for a very frustrating time.  This was my use-case.It is not sturdy.  Very lightweight.  Can't extend the legs wide enough to provide more support.It can fall over if you press the sides of the tablet. (flips backwards)It constantly moves when interacting with the screen.Want to quickly wipe down the screen to clean off fingerprints? Hah! Your tablet will be on the floor, even if you try to hold it.I couldn't even be bothered to return it and just gave it away.  Replaced it with one of those full cases that has a stand built into it.Also, the non-slip material they're using on the bottom has a smell to it and will outgas for a while, along with get on whatever touches it.",Verified Purchase,85 people found this helpful
2,KCWM,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as good as the other, same-style stand we use, but it works.","  After purchasing a similar stand from a brand and it working without any issues, and having good experiences with the Amazon Basics brand, I bought this as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my kid. Unfortunately, it did not hold up nearly as well as the other.The gripping material on the bottom came undone within the first week. Without it, the stand is more prone to being moved. The adhesive used is weak and there's not a lot of plastic on the bottom to attach it to. It comes loose almost every time we use it. An iPad Mini is primarily used in it, so it's not like a heavier iPad or table is being used. My kid doesn't like ""the dinky stand"".If I had to do it over, I'd spend a little more and get another stand.",Verified Purchase,84 people found this helpful
3,MJTop Contributor: Pets,4.0 out of 5 stars,A couple minor flaws but overall a very good universal tablet stand.,"  From many of the pictures I saw previously posted of this stand, I thought I might be stuck with the middle arm rest extending above a smaller tablet and looking unsightly.That turned out not to be the case with my small 7"" tablet at the angle I like it to be tilted at while sitting at my desk. As you can see in the pictures, it can be adjusted just barely low enough to not show the middle support above my tablet (Nexus 7).I was almost ready to just go out and buy a small and cheap 99Â¢ picture frame stand but I'm glad I opted for this stand that was made for the task at hand. Not only does it have rubber on the inside of the arms where the tablet rests but it also has rubber on the bottom to help prevent it from easily sliding around your desk.A couple of things I would consider a negative is 1) at times when I was moving the legs and adjusting the stand it almost felt like I had to use so much force that something was going to break, and 2) If you want to rest the tablet on the stand in portrait mode with the webcam at the top and your charging port is on the bottom, you aren't going to be able to have it plugged into power at the same time as the legs only keep it 3/8"" off the desk surface which isn't enough room for your typical MicroUSB, USB Type-C or Lightning cord to fit (see picture).",Verified Purchase,84 people found this helpful
4,Michael St James,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for 7 and 10-inch tablets, in or out of cases.","  This is a clever device with flawless engineering. Yes, it could be made of titanium or aluminum, but unless you plan on throwing it into the primate cage at the zoo, the plastic seems properly reinforced and strong enough for its intended purpose. My interest was to find a compact vertical orientation standing device to use with both small and large tablets, since we have a Kindle Keyboard, a PaperWhite and an original Fire as well as a Google Nexus 7 and a couple of Nexus 10s. This stand works just fine for horizontal orientation as well, but I never use mine that way.This device scores in the 10-ring for all my devices, both in and out of the cases. I only take mine out of the cases to change to another or for cleaning. The horizontal arms have three detents. I used the widest detent for the Nexus 10, and the middle detent for all other smaller devices. The narrowest detent is the closed (folded up) position. I didn't count the detents on the vertical arm where it joins the base (many), but it ratchets to positions that would satisfy any conceivable need. The vertical arm is divided in half by a joint with four detents allowing for the adjustment of the flat upper part of the arm so you can have it rest flush on the back of your device.I have added pictures of Nexus 7 and 10 and for Kindle Fire in the stand. I initially adjusted the arm for the larger tablet, and didn't bother to change it for the smaller devices, and it worked fine that way. (Edit note: Though all 6 pics seemed to UL OK, I see that Amazon is only displaying 3 of the 6. Oh, well.)I put my Galaxy Note 2 in it (vertically) just to check the fit, and it's fine! I hadn't thought of that until I received my stands. I'm ordering a third one tonight so I can keep on my desk for the phone, instead of just laying it flat.Both of the horizontal arms have a soft, tacky black anti-skid insert over in the entire length of their bottoms. Very effective. This same material is applied on the outside surface of the resting grooves cut into the top of the arms. Once again, very effective. The flat articulating surface of the upper half of the vertical arm has this same material applied to it.I used all of the devices in the stand, swiping vigorously horizontally and vertically, and the devices always remained secure in the stand, and did not slide on the surface of the counter.I bought two of these, one for my wife.Five stars because I can't find one thing to complain about.",Verified Purchase,379 people found this helpful
5,Coffeelover,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great affordable stand,"  Great affordable stand.  Helped me turn my new IPad Air 2 and blue tooth keyboard into a mini ""lap top."" I have found the various positions that you can adjust for the stand to be quite a nice fit for my needs.  I really like that you can bend the upper portion of the vertical support to get the best angle for your use.  It also folds back up into a nice small size, making it very portable.",Verified Purchase,63 people found this helpful
6,Joey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable,"  After reading all of the great reviews I was very eager to receive and use this product. I am so confused because almost all the feedback is positive, so maybe my product is defective?? All it takes is the lightest tap on my iPad to cause the entire stand(and with it, the iPad) to fall over. Matter of fact, I can't even swipe the bottom to unlock my iPad without it toppling over let alone open any apps with a light tap of my finger! I am upset because I am always satisfied with AmazonBasics product lines, however this stand is virtually unusable. Hopefully it's just a defective stand, so I will return it for a replacement and update this review accordingly.",Verified Purchase,45 people found this helpful
7,Peter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Straightforward and Uncomplicated.,"  This item works. It's a straightforward and uncomplicated item. I use it to prop up my iPad Air with a slim case. This item holds the tablet very securely in both portrait and landscape mode. The stand collapses into a small and portable size that easily fits into my man bag.I tried to use this with my iPad Pro 12.9, and it wasn't great. In landscape mode, the stand held the tablet, but it was a little shaky. In portrait mode, the tablet was just too top heavy. Since I use the Pro tablet mostly in portrait mode, this stand wasn't suitable. However, I don't fault the stand, since it's not designed for the larger tablets. I just wanted to tell other people my experience in case they're curious about using it with the iPad Pro.",Verified Purchase,24 people found this helpful
8,John Williamson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Swiss Army Knife of Tablet Travel Stands: It's a winner,"  This blackÂ AmazonBasics Portable Fold-Up Travel Stand  Â is a truly versatile device.  It's compact and quite well engineered, and is the perfect portable accompaniment for the Kindle Fire, the legacy Kindle e-book readers, the new iPad or iPad 2, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and probably many more.  In my case, I have a Kindle Fire and a Kindle 2, so interchangeability between devices is not only important, but also essential. For those wishing for the quick points, here they arePros:* Can be quickly and easily adjusted into a wide variety of viewing angles* Very sturdy construction; doesn't feel junky or cheap* Quite convenient; folds up to 7 x 1 x 1 inches for good portability* Soft foam-padded surfaces on bottom prevent sliding; won't scratch furniture* Padded grips where the tablet or e-reader sits; keeps device in place; no scratching* Foam padded back support; keeps tablet stable and won't scratch the case* Good IKEA-style simple Quick Start instruction sheet in multiple languages* Frustration-Free Packaging; no irritating plastic clamshell to open when receivedCons:* Very minor point: most devices can't be charged in the vertical (portrait) mode; there's no space for most cable connectorsIn Use:I had picked up theÂ AmazonBasics Mini Travel Stand  Â earlier, and at barely over two inches long have found it excellent for quick field use and extreme portability. Small and very compact, it folds up and snaps shut so that it can put in your pocket (or purse) without taking up much room. That one is good for stable, flat surface locations where there isn't too much activity going on, and I've found it excellent with my Kindle 2 with it's 6-inch display when it's removed from its leather cover. The newer Kindle Touch or any of the newer versions with the 6-inch E Ink display would have no problems with the Mini Travel Stand.At 7 x 1 x 1 inches, the newerÂ AmazonBasics Portable Fold-Up Travel Stand  Â may lack the compactness of the Mini version, but when it comes to outright versatility, this is where it really shines.  To begin with, its range of adjustments is exceptionally good, and I did not have to remove theÂ Marware Vibe Case Cover  Â from my Kindle Fire, nor the leather cover from my Kindle 2, in order to use it with this stand.  It can be quickly changed in a wide array of positions for viewing, in either the horizontal (landscape) or vertical (portrait) position.  And using it with the Kindle Fire, I found that it wasn't moving all over the place when used with a stylus.The foam padding has been placed in all of the crucial areas where it may be needed.  The foam-padded surfaces on bottom of the feet prevent sliding, even when being used on a flat surface with a stylus, and it won't scratch your furniture.  The adjustable foam-padded back support helps keeps tablet stable in use, and the padded grips where the tablet or e-reader sits add to the stability.  This one is designed where it won't scratch the case.Note that there are some other brands, such as theÂ Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand  , that may offer a similar design and features as this one, but I personally trust the AmazonBasics products that I've found here as they have a decent guarantee, and based on my experience with one defective item, I do like their responsiveness when things go wrong.Bottom Line:It didn't take me long to figure out that this AmazonBasics Portable Fold-Up Travel Stand would be the default choice for use with my Kindle Fire, and the Mini Travel Stand would be the one for my Kindle 2.  Each one has its good points, as you can see here, but that's a subjective choice, so take for what it's worth to you.  Admittedly if I had to pick just one I would go with the newer Fold-Up Travel Stand simply because of its overall usefulness and functionality.This AmazonBasics Portable Fold-Up Travel Stand has true Swiss Army knife versatility, and I have no problems recommending this as an excellent product at a very good price.6/8/2012",Verified Purchase,269 people found this helpful
9,V. Gaines,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for external monitors too!,"  After seeing this pop up on a weekly deal email, I thought it might just be the solution I was looking for to help with an external monitor that I travel with. I have an ASUS portable USB external monitor that I use as a second monitor with my laptop that came with a very lame ""stand"" of sorts. The case that you store it in can somehow be contorted to act as a stand...which I have never successfully got to work. I end up leaning it on lamps and such at hotels while traveling. But this little stand worked great! Fully adjustable to fit whatever circumstances, and cushioned to keep the screen from sliding around. It folds up to about 7"" long by 1"" tall and 1"" wide...which fits perfectly in my backpack. I know it was intended for iPads and such...and I can see where that would work great too, but if anyone has the same problem I had with a travel monitor...this is THE solution for it!",Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful
10,GOLDENDUDE,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good looking build but no cigar.,"  Bought this for my work tablet. The stand by looking on Amazon before I bought it looked sturdy,but when I received  it isn't. Only configuration that holds the tablet  is the picture  I took. The places it has moving parts do just that they move there's no way to lock it to any position. You put the slightest pressure  on table and the stand fails to hold its position.  I'll  use it in the 1 position that works .

12,kapran,3.0 out of 5 stars,Why the stand is just OK and NOT 5 Stars,"  The stand arrived today on time and it's certainly on budget. As usual the packaging was the first thing I didn't like because I hate packaging that is not user friendly when I'm trying to get it open without damaging the box or bag, or bubble pack. It came in a compact box and was undamaged. What it lacks is the notching is too small to hold a tablet inside a case, and my case is vinyl and somewhat compact and thin. Whoever designed this didn't have the forethought to even test drive it with ""Amazon's Choice"" of commonly used tablet cases and then say how well it fits so many models. Well not so fast. Who uses a tablet most? Well that's kids for sure and those should and normally do have a kids case most of the time but those are big and bulky and I might not expect that to fit a regular stand but I'm an ADULT. And who doesn't want a slimline case and compatible stand so you can have it vertical or horizontal INSIDE THE CASE? They didn't even give it any thought whatsoever and say ""well we can't speak to that"", well you should have because I sure would have and I'm not a product designer, engineer, or tester I'm a consumer and we have the expectation that products will be evaluated in a variety of use cases scenarios. And it at least adjusts quite easily to many positions, folds up well - nice and compact, lightweight and the price was right. But it was easily within the potential of 5 stars if anyone with a brain had even spent 5 minutes thinking about it.",Verified Purchase,NaN
13,Sheryl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice collapsible stand for Kindle,"  I bought this to use to prop my kindle on when I want to read at the kitchen table. I have a kindle oasis in one of Amazonâ€™s â€œleatherâ€ cases that opens like a book and auto turns on the kindle when opened. This stand works perfectly for it even while itâ€™s in its case. I just have to tilt the tall part of the stand forward a bit to accommodate the smaller size of the kindle and I can adjust the legs to a variety of settings too get the kindle to sit at whatever angle I want it at. Itâ€™s easy to collapse and open too. I havenâ€™t tried to use it with my ipad yet but I donâ€™t need to because my iPad is in a keyboard case that opens like a laptop, so I canâ€™t speak to how it works with that. But if you want something for your actual kindle, I can say this works well, even with the small Oasis.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
14,ccsteveTop Contributor: Pets,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised,"  I was looking for a small adjustable tablet stand for reading the online newspaper in the mornings. I had been using my husband's large padded one that works great in his lap while watching tv, but I needed one for tabletop use while having my morning coffee. I like this primarily because it folds down into a small size (about 2"" x 5"") when not in use so that I can put it away out of sight. It has two legs which form the stand and they can be adjusted in width to accommodate any size tablet or phone. And the single upright piece that forms the back can be bent to several positions depending how upright you wish your tablet or phone to be. Overall, a great little device for the purpose.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

And I'm one of the some.I like to e-read my morning paper with breakfast. That means I need my Kindle to stand upright. Alas, the new cases all seem to be great with horizontal balance but a wobble nightmare vertically.

Woo Hoo!I've tested it with pressing the on/off and volume buttons as well as swiping and selecting on screen. Firm and vibration free.

16,Int93,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for an external monitor!,"  I got this originally for an iPad (4th Gen), which it worked great. I found another iPad stand that was super slim and light and worked well enough for me so I ended up giving this to my Wife for her iPad mini. But then I ended up purchasing a portable touch screen monitor and I asked her if I could switch her out for my other one for a week and see if it worked out and she could tell me which one she liked better since I would end up buying one of the 2 iPad stands again if it ends up working for my monitor. She actually likes this one better and felt it more stable, which I would agree it is overall more stable.It ended up working perfectly for my monitor. I like to put it in vertical orientation often and this actually works surprisingly well. It is the best option I have found to be able to bring to and from school and to also fit on a lap desk that I use since I change rooms a lot and I can just pick up everything in one go. When picking up and going the screen can topple over, but that's an extreme case, for normal usage I go back and forth between my monitors and touch the screen a lot and it has never toppled or failed me when I prop it up in the way in the picture. I can even quickly switch it to horizontal orientation quickly and easily.I bough some adhesive backed foam to add to the front edge as I felt like it was rubbing the back of my monitor slightly. Also after some use with the monitor the adhesive pads that already came attached where you set the iPad in started to get smooshed and come apart a little, so if you have something that is wide that may be something to expect. I just took them off and added a full layer of adhesive pad instead of the little bit that was just on the front side of the grooves. I pack this up and take it with me to and from school everyday, love it.",Verified Purchase,NaN
17,Gary L. Herstein,5.0 out of 5 stars,When you get tired of holding your tablet,"  I'd previously been repurposing a plate-holder to try and keep my (Samsung 9"") tablet up. That didn't last.This is sturdy, flexible, and compact, all the things I require (esp. if we get past the pandemic & I can travel again.) Props to the designers and engineers who made it, this does the job it says it is supposed to do, a rare enough quality these days that I am really excited to see it made real. It easily accommodates my Samsung in either the vertical or horizontal position. In either position, it is solid enough to not fall over when I use the touch screen. But if I'm using the blue-tooth keyboard, I can set it to whatever angle does not wash out the screen with ambient light.I've only tested it on MY tablet, so obviously your mileage may vary.

18,ATLBrysco,5.0 out of 5 stars,The most basic design is usually the most elegant.,"  EXCELLENT stand for my 7"" tablet. This is utilized for a low-end tablet that really does little more than function as a digital photo frame on my nightstand. However, because the table was low-end the cheap case for it doesn't keep it propped up because it's too flimsy and slides all over a wooden surface.This stand is perfect - lightweight, yet sturdy, I like the fact that it has ""grippy"" material all over to not only help keep the tablet in place, but allows the stand to not slide across the surface of the nightstand. Further, because the design is basic and demure, it doesn't detract focus away from the tablet as it rotates through images.There are many tablet stands on here that are ridiculous in cost - some up to $40+. This does the job beautifully, is inexpensive and is exactly what I wanted. Good job, AmazonBasics!",Verified Purchase,NaN
19,Jet Builder,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An Impulse Buy, But One I'm Glad I Made!","  I had looked for a cover for my Kindle Oasis that could serve as a stand as well.  I didn't find anything that struck my fancy, but this was one of the suggested products when I was looking for the Kindle covers (I bought the MoKo Case and have had a love hate relationship with it).  For the price I was willing to give the stand a try and I'm glad I did.  The design is compact; it can hold my Kindle Oasis securely in any orientation on almost any surface.  It folds down to a size similar to an eyeglass case.  It's very lightweight.  It adjusts to multiple different positions allowing you to use it with other small tablets or even your smart phone.  I use this stand every day with my Kindle and I love how the rubberized surface of the legs grip countertops.  The notches in the legs that hold the lower edge of my Kindle also have that same rubberized surface.  As does the adjustable upstanding arm that supports the rear.  All I can say is that I can't imagine that I would have had the same positive experience with my Kindle without this cool little device!UPDATE - 11 JUNE, 2020.Well, I've had this little device for over a year.  I use it several times a day to hold my Kindle while i read.  Other than being slightly looser than when i first received it there hasn't been any degradation.

20,D. White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should be your #1 item on school supply list,"  I brought this as a stand for my kindergartener's ipad for virtual learning. This may be the most indestructible thing currently made. It's multi positional, allowing her to adjust to her line of sight and be able to get a perfect  angle on her camera. Its non-skid grip pads makes sure that the base does not move and there are also pads are on the notch where the tablet rests, so that will not budge either, even when her desk is bumped by her siblings. No need to take bulky cases off, it will fit with a bulky case!! It folds and closes small enough to fit in her pencil case, which is awesome for when she does go in for face to face testing. The schools should buy this in bulk for the students instead of spending the extra $$ on cases with integrated stands that either don't fold to an ideal level to capture the student on camera or rip/ break/tear after 2 months of DAILY 8-10 hour use. If you can, buy more and gift to other kids!!!",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I am very happy with my case, but because the tablet is rectangular and much taller than it is wide, using the built-in stand within the case, is not practical for how I use it (on my lap, which is under a comforter). So I am very glad I got this Amazon Basics stand as well. It is very sturdy, stable, highly adjustable, and can be used on both hard AND soft surfaces. The best part, is that I don't even need to take my tablet out of it's case to use while it's on this stand. The stand folds up to stored wherever you wish.

22,Carl L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very useful for holding a Kindle, once you know how to open it.","  When I received this item, I thought it was defective.  I could open one of the legs, but the other was quite resistant.  I thought I would break it if I tried any harder, and requested a replacement.  Amazon sent one with no quibbling, and did not ask me to return the original.  Lo and behold, when the replacement arrived, it was also hard to open one leg.  This time I pulled harder, and it opened.  Subsequent to that first time, it opened more easily.  It holds a Kindle at a good angle for reading when you are sitting at a table or desk, and folds up small so you can easily transport or store it when not in use.After my success with the replacement, I tried the original and with my new knowledge to tug harder, it works too.

23,DEC,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK for the price.  I little light but that is commensurate with the low price.,  It's OK for the price since it is cheap.  IT is a fairly lightweight bit of plastic though.  After - check out the weight at 3.2 oz.  Very light.The one I got was prtty much fozen on one side initially.  I had to use a fair amount of force to move one side the first time.  After that it was like the plastic on the small nubs that click along got ronuded off a bit and it was therewfter easier.  The adjustments are somewhat granular but they will suffice for now.  I doubt it will see other than occasional use from me.  I got it to use with a fire HD10 i just bought and it will just work for that although I feel the HD10 is pushing the envelope for the size device this handles.  It does fold up very nice and compact so if portability is your desire this should be great.  I only use my fire at home so that is of limited value to me.  If you want something heavy for stability this is not it.  IF I used a stand with the HD10 often I would keep looking and get something heavier.

25,Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greatmvwith 15.6 inch Portable Monitor,"  Omg. I never thought I could be so excited for such a little/inexpensive thing, but I absolutely adore this.  A few months ago I invested in a 15.6 inch portable monitor to make working from home easier on my laptop.  The monitor came with a carrying case which also doubled as its stand.  It was fine, but not great.  The case was bulky on my tiny desk and easy to knock over or would sometimes just fall down.I saw this little guy and though he was recommended for tablets, figured I'd give it a shot.  This takes up much less space and is sturdy enough to hold the monitor well.  It also has non-slip grip  on the bottom (not fool-proof of course, but much better than the previous stand).

29,Tyler Ashton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"NOTE: This does not have any way to tighten the stand. However,","  First of all for 12$ this is a great little stand. It's compact and you can take it with you easily. It's easy to pop open and my ipad fits in it. I did have to be crafty with my case ON but I made it work. It works a lot better with a case off unless you have a silicone case. It's plastic, but sturdy.If you draw the only qualm is if you put too much pressure it will move positions because there's no way to lock it in place. But I got it to work just fine. Just don't push down too hard. This is more so made for like if you want to set your tablet up and watch something or to make quick notes or just small stuff like that. It does work for me but I can see that some might find that it doesn't lock annoying.Over all I love this little thing. It will do for now and it's a great option if you're strapped for cash.",Verified Purchase,NaN
30,B. Hackman,5.0 out of 5 stars,EVERY Tablet Should Have One!,"  This stand is so well designed I bought and extra one!  This stand solves the tipping or collapsing problem you get with the folio cases when you use a stylus.  The problem with Folio cases is you can adjust the angle and normally it will stay where you put it.  The minute you use a stylus on the Folio Case on the upper 50% of the display it could lift the bottom of the tablet out of the groves and your tablet could collapse.This stand is not only sturdy - it will hold your tablet in Landscape or Portrait position securely.  In fact I do not even take my tablet out of the Folio Case when I use it.  The groves in the stand can hold the thinnest tablet or most cases with the tablet in the case!  It is very portable folding to 1 inch by 7 inch by 1 1/4 inch.  It is well padded to protect your tablet.  Some people who have reviewed this stand complained that they can not charge the unit when in Portrait mode.  I know my Amazon Fire HDX 8.9"" has auto rotation and charges perfectly in Portrait mode just turn it upside down..  Please make sure you have rotation turned on. For those of you who like to use your tablet at lunch or when having a cup of coffee - this stand elevates your tablet 3/4 to 1 inch above the surface (So if you have a spill, the stand will allow your spill to go under the stand - NOT on your tablet!)  That is a small price to pay for a unit that does so much.Conclusion - This is the best designed most cost effective stand offered today at an extremely reasonable price.  Buy with confidence - This stand is a winner!  I hope this helps you.",Verified Purchase,14 people found this helpful
31,Curtis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Tablet Stand,"  I'm very impressed by this stand. First off, it's a fairly simple and compact design, the main arm that holds the tablet upright has two points of articulation, both of which are joints with an interlocking teeth design. This does mean that it has slightly fewer positions than some of the aluminum tension lock stands, but it is very sturdy and I've been able to get any angle that I could reasonably need. The two feet each have 3 positions: folded against each other, spaced slightly apart such that you could fit a phone on in vertically, and spaced farther apart for tablet use. The feet have notches to accommodate your device, and the nothces, the arm, and the bottom of the feet have this black rubber-foam stuff that does an excellent job of keeping everything in place- nothing is going to move unless you want it to.All of my devices fit in this even with their cases on, and even with the larger cases- I have my Samsung Tab S3 9.7 inch in a leather case that more than doubles its thickness, and the stand still works perfectly. I really can't think of anything to complain about, other than I might want one made out of a slightly heavier material, but the black plastic is fairly heavy duty, and travels well due to it's light weight",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

I ended up getting a Fohloy adjustable grip handle thing that slapped at the back of my 12.9 that does a better job than this. I can use this for other things though like propping up frames and books for decorations. I also found the same or unbranded product a few dollar cheaper else where.

This stand fit both those needs.  It is very sturdy and adjustable; can be adjusted to almost any angle.  It easily holds a tablet in either portrait or landscape mode.

46,Dave Kramer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great with my bulky case,"  I purchased a case that simply fails as a stand - it only provides two viewing angles, and both slant upwards. This makes it hard to view when sitting in the bath (at a lower angle) or wandering around the kitchen.Rather than ditch the case (which otherwise is great), I bought this stand and it works well. I fold the cover behind the iPad, which does it make it super thick. Most stands wouldn't accommodate it without removing it from the case but this one works great. The iPad + case is a bit thick for the two notches on the V-shaped base but it still wedges in OK and seems relatively stable (more stable than when I tried standing the iPad straight up in the case alone).I may pick up another 1-2 so I can keep these where I need them around the house, and someday post-COVID I'll pack one up for travel.",Verified Purchase,NaN
47,Vicky and Tom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works for a smartphone; annoying to adjust,"  I should start out by saying I am using this for a phone, which is actually a hair smaller than the minimum size for the stand. That presents some issues, but the rating is for the stand overall, not phone-specific issues (although I will describe those too).Bought this to use with a phone & wireless keyboard for a superlight email/browsing setup. I originally had a tablet with a kickstand case, but when I got a smartphone I didn't want a bulky case so I got this to keep the functionality.Overall it works pretty good. You can tell it would work better with a medium-sized tablet. It does work with my 5.7"" smartphone, but it has to be at its smallest/most-folded setting to fit, and the top of the back arm pokes above the screen which is a bit silly. But the feet are grippy and the adjustment mechanism is solid, and I think it would work with all but the smallest smartphones.The adjustment is actually the only drawback. The mechanism is nice and firm - so firm that I have to use both hands to re-size it. And it adjusts in notches/clicks, so getting super-fine adjustment is hard. Adjusting the angle of the tablet also could be more intuitive - the back arm pivots, but the legs also have adjustable spread, and both settings change the adjustment, so you have to monkey around a bit to get it just right.Still, very solidly built, and works with a 'phablet' phone. Also nice that the nooks that catch the bottom edge of the phone have non-stick on them, but don't stick up so far as to block access/view to the bottom edge of yer phone/tablet.TLDR: Works with smartphones but looks a bit silly. Adjusting requires taking the device off and using both hands.",Verified Purchase,NaN

You need to figure out the right combination of the three supports, otherwise you can encounter the problem others have.

It won't tip as long as the tablet is positioned at least 30 degrees or so. The bottom edge of the tablet has to be in firmly fitted into the notches on the legs.

58,Clarence Threepwood,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprised at all the positive reviews!  Yes, it has some plusses (sort of), but there are decided problems!","  OK, first off, the plusses.  It sort of works as a stand.  It sorts of works somewhat better with smaller tablets-- e.g., the iPad Mini.  You can, sort of, make some adjustments of the legs and the back prop.  But, if that sounds way short of a ringing endorsement, that's because it is!Several problems with this stand.  As some of the more discerning reviewers have pointed out, it is unstable--at least it is if it is on a dining room table cloth.  Perhaps the underside grippy things help on an uncovered desk.  At it stands (or doesn't! :-)), it wobbles and can easily tip over.  I've tried it with both an iPad Air and an iPad Mini.  It works better for the smaller tablets, but switching between the two is a nuisance!  The feet need to be splayed out as far as they can go to get even a modicum of stability for the larger tablet, but then the mini tablets can't fit; they'll fall between the legs (portrait).Another big issue.  Lift your tablet and the darn stand often sticks to it!  It then falls to the ground, the table, wherever with a clatter.Another BIG problem... there is no felt covering on the top side of the feet where the tablet rests.  It has the felt on the front top side, but not the back!  THAT MEANS IT'S RIFE WITH SCRATCH POTENTIAL!  It needs a better design so that the entire area is covered.  You can see that on some of the clones (or, wait-- this is a clone)--those have the felt on the back and front.  I know that a different stand (a mini-plastic easel) scratched the edge of my Mini because the hard plastic dug into it.  So, felt covering is important.  On both this and that, one can cut out and put some sticky felt strips on to cover things, which generally solves the problem.  Not elegant, but it works pretty well.Amazingly, overall, this stand is *worse* than the $2.99 mini-adjustable easel stand we bought at Jo Ann Fabrics!  That stand has an easy to adjust back frame, which means it is easy to change the viewing angle--it smoothly goes to any angle you want.  In contrast, this stand does not work well.  Both the backing and the feet cannot be smoothly moved into another position-- instead, there are notches and you have move from one set gap to another.  When moving the feet, it even seems as if one is going to break a notch!Stability is another issue, especially if you simply want to move the stand and tablet over some.  Move the stand with the tablet and it's almost sure to fall over!  This morning, I even had grabbed the upright prop part with the iPad, when I moved it over.  ""No problem"", I naively thought.  All of a sudden, it fell over on its side!I'd return this to Amazon, but at its low price, it's not worth the time, hassle, mailing, or effort.",Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful

Has the necessary structure to handle the large Fire in portrait mode (so many stands only really work in landscape).  Very lightweight and collapses to almost nothing.  The only gripe I have is that the foam tape on the bottom that is supposed to keep the stand from slipping peeled off within a week of receipt.  The problem is that the feet are molded with cavities in the bottom to keep the weight down and the foam does not have much to stick to.  Solved that problem by filling the last few cavities with Bondo equivalent and then put small rubber bumpers on the bondo and at the top of the Y.  Even more stable now with the tripod contact.

64,Tony R.Top Contributor: Cooking,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Good Stand for Tablet Support,"  I ordered this stand as there are times, particularly when I'm watching a video or reading, that I don't want to hold my Kindle and wanted something it could rest on.  This stand works fine, but there are a few elements that I think could improve it.  First, there are no clips or restraining bars to keep your table from tipping forward or slipping off the stand.  Certainly, if you simply put this stand on a flat surface then it's probably not an issue.  But I sometimes use it when in bed for reading, etc and the surface is not always flat.  Inevitably it falls forward or slips to the left or right.  There are slight grooves in the 'feet' where the tablet sits, but they aren't deep enough to securely hold the tablet.  A minor issue to be sure, but the stand would be improved if it had some additional restraints or locks.  Still, for the money a good buy.",Verified Purchase,5 people found this helpful

67,Harmon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Takes up too much table space,"  This stand functions pretty well to hold my 10 inch iPad Pro, although I can't quite get an angle I like . YMMV. But my main gripe about it is that because of its design, it takes up too much table space as compared to other, smaller, stands. It occupies a six inch square on the table top, which might not sound like much but when you are doing something other than just having a cup of coffee, I find it hard to get it it acceptably positioned for reading.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
68,Kenny,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but ....","  I was pretty impressed with the product when it arrived. It is pretty sturdy, though a bit stiff, especially the legs. I used it for 2 days without any issues with both my phone and an iPad. Today when I was trying to adjust it on the table, the self-adhesive anti-skid material on the bottom rolled and stuck to the table instead of the stand. After pulling it mostly off before realizing there was an issue. I've tried to stick it back on, but I don't think it will stick well. Sigh! I actually liked this.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
69,Erik Gordon Bainbridge,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well made, functional, inexpensive","  A solid, basic, well-done product, like all AmazonBasics items I've purchased.  I mostly use it for my Samsung 8"" tablet (with a thick Bobj rugged case), but it also works for my Moto G4 phone (also with a rugged case).  If you're looking for a tablet stand that will impress people with its appearance, this is the wrong one for you, but if you want a solid, inexpensive stand that does what it's supposed to, this one fits the bill.The one drawback, as many reviewers have noted, is that you can't charge the device while it's in the stand.  For me, it's not a problem.  It's not good for the battery to have it continually plugged in, so I charge mine at night and use it solely on battery during the day.",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful
70,FloridAmazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So good, I bought three!","  With the 9.7-inch iPad Pro I am finally able to make the transition to all-digital, and having a handy place to keep this iPad so it is always within easy reach is key to that transition. I bought one of these stands to keep in my briefcase and quickly realized I needed more. Now I have three -- one for my office and two for home. They are well worth the price. Folded up they are very portable, but they are quickly opened and can be universally adjusted. I'm watching more and more content online, so it's great to prop my iPad up on this stand and settle in to binge watch something on Amazon Prime Video.These stands are also great for charging your tablet. Just place the side with the charging port to the left or right and plug it in. Like all the Amazon Basics products I have purchased, they are well made and affordable.

72,R. Ybarra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Tablet Stand for the Price,"  This has been one of the better tablet stands I've found.  It works well for iPad, iPad Mini and Galaxy Tab.  It even does a decent job on the LG3 and can be used on an iPhone 6 in a pinch.  It folds compactly and is very adjustable.  Once in position, the arms are tight enough that they will not shift.  I have had it about 18 months now and it is holding up well.  The sole issue I've had with this stand is that, depending on tablet placement, there is not enough clearance in the feet for the charging cable to plug in without putting undo strain on the cable.  This is a rather minor point, however.  You also need to make sure that you spread the feet wide enough for your tablet model to give sturdy support.Yes, there are some better stands available, however they cost several times the price of this one and they tend to be more artistic than functional.  As I say in the title, this stand provides the best use for the price - something I've come to expect from Amazon Basics.  Since everyone in the family is now fighting over who gets to use this one, I will be buying a couple more.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I'm not sure how long they're supposed to last, but I was hoping for longer than this. I was folding it up after lunch, and the top section came apart. There's a spring and a nut and something else I couldn't find - under my work desk - that holds it together. If I knew what the something else was, I'd try to fix it. If you don't mind spending $10 every few years (although it was only $8.99 two years ago), then this is a great stand.

It moves in so many positions, but is sturdy enough to hold my devices in any position I need them in. I'm very pleased to see all the different combinations and variations of positions this stand has!The back of the stand doesn't hook to my device, however it has a nice rubber texture to keep the device from slipping. But here's the fun part:  I also just received the Marware Kindle touch cover today that has a place to put my hand through the flap(elastic strap) when I fold it backward (see my next review) and I put that strap Over the back of the stand and Yippee!!

108,Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Useful Stand,"  Pros:This is a really neat little gizmo. It's highly adjustable and the notches and padding attached to the stand are a neoprene-like material that is a high friction surface to keep your device from sliding.You can move the bottom legs together pretty close and the top arm down to ""pinch hold"" a phone, or adjust it in a number of ways to hold a larger tablet. Decadence comes into play when you use this stand to hold a tablet in position for hands free viewing of video when laying in bed or on a couch.As others have said, when a device is in portrait mode there is not enough clearance to plug-in a charging cord through the bottom. You can, however, circumvent this by placing the stand so that the front slightly overhangs on a book (for example).I paired this stand with an AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard as well as a bluetooth speaker, and I feel like I've attained small computer nirvana.Cons:The only downside is that the stand doesn't have enough ""heft"" to hold my tablet in place when I push down on the pressure sensitive surface of my tablet (i.e. the stand doesn't have enough push back) -- but that's mostly when I'm entering my pattern to unlock my device. I've found using swipe motions with my onscreen keyboard problematic as well (hence the use of the bluetooth keyboard).Other Thoughts:If I ever stop using this for my tablet, then this might make a great stand to hold a picture or some tchotchke.

The grandkids say they're worth it and use them every day. Anyone who needs to prop up their phone or tablet a lot should definitely have one of these! No complaints about this handy little helper!",Verified Purchase,NaN

114,Another Avid Reader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing little device,"  I use this in cafes to hold either my phone or a Fire tablet, along with a Bluetooth keyboard.

115,Farnoosh Brock,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stand for the iPad,"  I got this for my husband. He has an Apple iPad 2 and is loving using it. His hands would get weary of holding the iPad when watching movies or scrolling and this stand was the perfect solution.We also wanted to make sure we order from AmazonBasics to experience their products. It arrived as fast as it said it would.Packing was done well and in a minimal way - I like that. The adjustable table stand is all folded up when you get it. It's pretty sturdy and you have to pry it open and then adjust it to the level and angle that you like.This stand is light and portable and you can just throw it in your bag and travel with it. Hardly takes up any space. It also works with the Kindle which is really nice, although I have yet to prop it up on the bed to hold my Kindle. Perhaps I'll give that a whirl. Love this great tool and highly recommend it.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
116,Merry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Compact, but weird angles","  It's a cool concept and it really does fold up to a tiny size. It's also cheap enough that I don't expect perfection. My only gripe is that the adjustments are pretty big when you click it into position; that is, you don't have a lot of angles to choose from. So when I use it with a webcam, it's either chopping off the top of my head or the bottom of my head. I'd still give it three stars for people who use video chat a lot, or five stars for people who don't.",Verified Purchase,NaN
117,J. Devenberg,3.0 out of 5 stars,I usually love Amazon Basics products,"  I usually love Amazon Basics products, but I'm mildly disappointed in this one.  I figured an Amazon Basics tablet stand would work well with Amazon's own tablets.  I have the 2017 Fire HD8 and, while this stand will hold it, it isn't as stable as I'd like.  It seems pretty clear this stand was built with larger tablets in mind.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
118,KTH0707,4.0 out of 5 stars,ALMOST great!,  Perfect for most tablets. Especially at this price point. Very sturdy and simple. I did find that I can not charge my iPad while it in portrait orientation. There isn't enough clearance at the base to for the cable. So that was kind of a bummer as I use my iPad Air for teleconferencing and like to have it on a power source so that I don't kill the battery while doing so.Otherwise a very good stand.,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
119,Katherine,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have!!,"  When I was looking for a stand for my iPad mini, I was torn between about 6 different stands. I finally got this one because Iâ€™ve had great experiences with all things that are â€œAmazonBasicsâ€ (computer mouse, phone sleeve, phone charger and batteries). Ummmm now my great experience has continued. I wouldnâ€™t think thereâ€™d be much to say about a tablet stand, but yeah, this one is pretty great. I have absolutely nothing to compare it to, but all I know is that it perfect in every way. First of all, the grip on the bottom makes it to where it doesnâ€™t slip at ALL. If I have my iPad mini upright on the stand on a table, I can press on it with one finger and it doesnâ€™t move in the slightest. â€¦.Including the home button which requires a stronger push! You can position it in SO many different ways, allowing it to accommodate your every need! :P I have a flip case on my iPad, but i seriously canâ€™t stand using the case as a stand even though itâ€™s meant for thatâ€¦ it always slips making it go flat! My boyfriend and I both have iPads, but I only bought one to make sure it was good enough, so weâ€™ll now be buying a second one!",Verified Purchase,NaN
120,Jessie Franklin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just OK,"  It worked alright for the first two months of use. My kindergartener used it daily for her iPad for online learning. The stand didn't manipulate well enough for her to seen well on screen, she was still barely visible. The pads to keep it from sliding on the table fell off after 1 day. After two months of use, the stand pretty much fell apart and all the screws and nuts came out at once. Couldn't put it back together.",Verified Purchase,NaN
121,just review it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"  I've owned thus for about four years now and it has performed excellent.I began using it with an Android tablet but a few years ago I switched to iPad and it works just as well. You can use it with a tablet or phone either horizontally or vertically. Even though my tablet case allows it to stand on its own, it only does so vertically.I also use a Logitech portable keyboard that only lays flat. I take the top edge of the keyboard and lay it in the front edge of the stand, this allows for a more natural feeling when typing.",Verified Purchase,NaN
122,Ansatz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use your tablet anywhere around the house,"  This lets you bring your tablet with you and watch videos or listen to music anywhere. It's great for watching videos while cooking or doing other chores around the house. It's also great for playing workout videos while you follow along. Your tablet basically turns into a portable TV. Because it's angled, the screen will be facing you and the speaker will not be against the ground, as would be the case if you just left it lying around. I have tried leaning my tablet against objects before I had this stand, but it always slips.",Verified Purchase,NaN
123,Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"  My brother bought our mother an Amazon Fire Tablet, which she loves. But she was using it in her sewing room and in the kitchen, for tutorials and recipes, but it didn't have a stand. So, I bought this for her and it is absolutely perfect.

124,Meurer Graphics,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfefct and simple stand,"  I am perfectly happy with the stand.  It is sturdy/rugged and easy to use at the same time.  I couldn't quite tell from the pictures and the product description how the stand unfolded.  I imagined there would be some kind of release or wingnut that would tighten and loosen the joints for adjustment.  It actually just clicks into place however you want it.  When you move the feet and head, you can feel the clicks as you move it.  The teeth on the interior of the device that are clicking are closely spaced allowing for finite adjustment to the precise position desired. I am using it for a travel monitor for my small form factor computer when traveling.  Can't wait to throw it in my backpack and go!",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
125,Gregory C. Poe,5.0 out of 5 stars,This really impresses me.,"  I use it with my tablet, and there have got to be around 30 different angles you can make with it, since there are multiple hinges. It even fits your cell phone, and I have used it to hold up my phone for shooting videos. Plus, it folds up into a 6-inch rid, so it can be easily stored in a drawer.

It has rubberized grips to keep the device from slipping, and collapses down to a very small size to easily fit in a backpack or purse.

Forget about all the other way more expensive options that fail to achieve the simple desired result. This holds my iPad 10.2 perfectly at any angle - landscape or portrait. It is very stable and sturdy. I gave up on finding a versatile cover that also worked as a stand and went with this option instead. It also looks quite nice.

128,Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for portable monitor too,"  Since I had to start working from home due to the whole mandate, I got a portable monitor that was 15 inches and it was really hard to find a stand that could support it. Most tablet stands are just for iPads and tablets which arenâ€™t bigger than about 14 inches.

I can adjust the arm in the back to set it to different heights, depending on what angle I want to observe the screen at.  The problem is, my tab S7+ is too heavy for it to support.  If I put it at certain angles, it will suddenly 'give out' and the stand arm will fall flat under the weight of the tablet.  The tab will fall down onto the table.  It is protected in an armored case, so it isn't broken, but it is frustrating that the stand will not support my device.",Verified Purchase,NaN

It has rubber on the legs that grip well and prevent sliding on the surface it is on. It adjusts to any position that I could possibly want. The tablet sits firmly in the slots and does not tip on either side. The design allows easy access to the on/off, volume controls. I love being able to just pick up the tablet and go without having to pry it out of corner holders. The only drawback is that you cannot rotate the tablet with the charger slot down as there is not enough clearance. I solve that problem by putting the stand on top of a small box that allows the tablet to overhang just enough in the front to get the clearance. This works fine also, without everything tipping.

167,Allan Lambkin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value stability and versatility,"  This is such a great product. Got it for my mother who loves her iPad and uses it constantly for FaceTime, email, social media and looking at recipes and videos while in the kitchen. It is highly functional and adaptable to multiple viewing angles and is great for FaceTime, reading and viewing content. We particularly love how sturdy it is and doesnâ€™t budge while interacting with the screen. Also has really grippy rubber legs that prevent it from moving or shifting on most surfaces. Although itâ€™s branded as a â€˜AmazonBasicsâ€™ product it has a solid feel to it and I feel like the build quality is great.  Unlike a lot of  other stands it folds up into a compact rectangle that makes it really portable and mobile.Will definitely be picking up a few more of theses as gifts for some of the other fam. Really happy with this product.",Verified Purchase,NaN
168,old hen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for holding without hiding.,"  I bought one of those pillows for my Kindle10 and when I put it in like it showed I couldn't access my icons and I would have to hold it by hand, not what I wanted.

169,EA4Afterburner!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Take a stand......,"  I bought three adjustable stands and gave two away as gifts. Works well and the pricepoint fits my budget. Good materials and has rubber pads on the backarm that holds the tablet in place and to whatever angle your tablet needs to be in. Bottom footings also have rubber pads and they adjust out into a V shape to hold your tablet in place. Prime eligible and got it in two days. I have a Sam Sung 10.5 inch tablet and it holds it very well. Its pretty compact in size when you fold it up after use. It works well with any tablet that has a tablet cover such as a Otterbox Defender as a example. It also works well if you have a separate keyboard and choose not to use the cover/keyboard as your platform. Summary, its a pretty neat gadget to have if you own a tablet and it fits in any bag due to its compact size. Hope that helps.",Verified Purchase,NaN

It adjusts to different size units, like nook, iPad, etc. I can even make it work for an iPhone 6s.  Legs adjust wider to narrower. Reading tilt extremely adjustable.

Great for hands free use! The legs can be brought close enough to hold an iPhone upright. It might be a little wobbly on a plane in that position but it's definitely sturdy on a solid surface. It will hold any device with a case or cover on it. The only downside is that it doesn't hold the device quite high enough to have the charger plugged in at the bottom.

For the price I figured I'd give it a shot since some reviews said it worked ok in landscape mode which is how I use my IPad 98% of the time.  The box was small & my kids laughed thinking there was no way it would hold this large IPad but it does just fine, even in portrait mode.  It has a small footprint but feels sturdy enough to hold my IPad at any angle I want without fear of collapsing or tipping over.  Combine function with the very low price & I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a stand for any tablet they have.",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful
180,WideAndNerdy,4.0 out of 5 stars,It does what it needs to do.,"  Works well for standing vertically or horizontally. I've owned this for about a month and it seems very sturdy. the rubbery foam pads on the bottom prevent sliding and the vertically extending arm has the same rubbery foam pad to help hold it in place. The arm locks firmly into a sufficient number of positions for viewing as long as the stand is not above your eye line and yet is easily adjusted without having to set or unset anything.Its a simple design thats well suited for holding a Fire Tablet. Mine is the 7 inch tablet but the stand appears big enough and its arms definitely hold firmly enough for the 8.9 inch tablet as well.EDIT: 8 months later, everything I've said is still true. However in that time I've discovered a small flaw, the base is not really thick enough to plug in the charge cable underneath if the Kindle is oriented so that the microUSB port is on the bottom. Normally this isn't a problem with the Amazon player as you can flip the tablet any which way you want to address that problem but if you're using a third party app, those sometimes only play the video on one orientation as one of my apps does. Its a minor nuisance. The killer is, they're only maybe 1mm to 2mm off of being thick enough, its like they based the width on the head of the micro usb plug but didn't account for the cable coming out the bottom.",Verified Purchase,NaN

I also bought a few other tablet stands to try out.  For my money, this is the best because of its simplicity, portability, and price.

It's not fancy but it works great.",Verified Purchase,NaN
184,BGunner,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as it should,  I had purchased a more stylish tablet holder that miserably failed and had to be sent back.  I spent a lot of time looking around and decided to try this one despite it's looks.  This one works exactly as it should and holds my tablet at the angle I want without slippage.  I have only displayed and charged the device in landscape so I can't speak for the ability to charge it in portrait.  I have an OtterBox on the device and it does not hinder the stand in the least.  My only wish for it was that it would be a bit nicer to look at but sometimes the simplest is the best.,Verified Purchase,NaN
185,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Stable, lightweight, well made, great design, fair price","  Stable, lightweight, quality construction, great design, fair price.  I use my ASUS MemoPad 7 in this stand and it is much more secure and adjustable than using the prop-up feature of my Tablet case.  The foam inserts are impressively well done. The whole geometry of this thing is just right.. So it works when my tablet is in either landscape or portrait orientation.  I take this with me in my commuter pack along with the tablet and my small laptop.So I can have the tablet open alongside my laptop, almost like a second display (with incoming emails always in view). The stand has the perfect range of adjustment. I wish it was a bit lighter weight, but I think as it is, the stand is about as light as they can make it without compromising stability and strength. A stand like this really improves the tablet experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one.UPDATE OCTOBER 2014-My wife each have one, and really enjoy them. Both are going strong with no problems or issues.",Verified Purchase,NaN
186,ZombieJill,5.0 out of 5 stars,... a two week vacation and it was a surprisingly useful little device to have,"  This little tablet stand was purchased to accompany me on a two week vacation and it was a surprisingly useful little device to have. I used this with my iPad, which has one of those magnetic covers that Apple makes that can convert into a stand of sorts, so I sort-of figured I wouldn't get much use out of this stand, but it is superior in just about every way to Apple's flimsy solution. The cruise (and the flights to said cruise) were rough, and my iPad kept falling over whenever everything would shake, but this stand held it firm and prevented my device from slipping and sliding around.I was able to use it comfortably with both my iPad 2 and my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone, thanks to the adjustable nature of the stand, and it works great for both devices regardless of orientation. It folds up tiny and fit perfectly into an inside pocket of my carry-on bag, and is made of sturdy plastic. Now that I'm home, I plan on keeping this in and around my kitchen to hold my tablet while I'm cooking, but it will definitely be coming with me during on my next vacation.I bought this in conjunction with theÂ AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple Devices (iPad, iPad Mini, iPhone)  Â so I could more comfortably write and work from the cruise ship, and the combination was excellent for my needs. I absolutely recommend both products to anyone looking to increase functionality while on the go.",Verified Purchase,NaN

188,David Pearlman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great ergonomics, will fit just about any size or dimension portable tablet, but be aware of the cheap construction","  I was looking for a fully adjustable stand to replace the one-position stand for my Microsoft Surface. This seemed to fill the bill and I ordered it.The pros:1) Fully adjustable. Very easy to put your tablet in almost any position from full 90 degree (standing up) to around 0 degrees (almost lying down).2) Sturdy enough (touching the screen, the tablet stays in place).3) The ""sticky"" rubber guides keep your tablet in place.4) Easy to set up.5) Will work with any standard tablet from 7"" to 12"" either portrait or landscape. It will actually work with larger tablets, but as things get too big, it's not going to be very stable.Now the con:1) It's almost entirely plastic, and it doesn't feel well enough constructed to last for the long run if you're using it as a travel device (where you'll continually be folding/unfolding it and possibly subjecting it to travel stresses). Should be fine if you just want to set it up somewhere and leave it.I was disappointed with the plastic design. It looks like metal in the pictures here. It's not. I guess at the price I shouldn't have expected anything more. I am a little worried how well it will hold up in the long term. But the ergonomics are great, and it's kind of amazing that there are so few comparably good general use stands at this price. Basically, Amazon has this particular market to themselves.On the whole, as long as you keep your expectations in check, this is a great little stand.",Verified Purchase,NaN

190,Jim C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect accessory for iPad Air 4,"  I love this stand. It's sturdy, easily adjustable and folds down to easily fit in a carrying case pocket.

That is completely forgivable, in my opinion.",Verified Purchase,NaN
191,M. Mccarthy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,"  I like the adjustability of this stand.  The bottom has padding that grips to the surface so it doesnâ€™t slide around.

194,Jus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple and effective.,"  This is a compact and very nice collapsible stand. I got this specifically for my Kindle so that I can read in portrait mode. I was foolish enough to buy a case that only allows for propping it up in landscape mode. So for the price this was worth a shot. I have no idea on how well it will hold up over time as I just got it, but I like the rubberized areas where your tablet or whatever will rest against, and it just does the job it sets out to do.",Verified Purchase,NaN
195,Iceman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for a wooden desk but comes up short in the bedroom!,"  Generally speaking a good item.  The stand has cushioned ""feet"" so that it wont scratch your desk.  However the cushioning gets stuck on anything soft like a pillow or blanket.  Which means that if you like to read in bed then the soft feet will get pulled out easily.  I put duct tape around the feet which solves the problem, though it doesn't look very attractive.  Amazon should either design cushions that stick to the plastic base but not to other cushions or perhaps make a ""sleepy time"" model to go along with this daytime model.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful
196,Brian McLaughlin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price! Tablet stand works very very well!,"  I purchased one of these because I had a class to take which no longer gives out physical books. I wound up using my Ipad and thought it would be nice to have a stand to read from. Boy is this thing great. It is very compact, as it folds down easily. It is very light since it is made from plastic. I also really like that it is so adjustable. It can fit many size devices on it, though i would say an iPhone 6 is too small unless it is in portrait mode. Any type of tablet should fit with ease though. it is also very stable, and has a bit of a coating on the bottom so it wont slip across a table or anything.  For the price, this is great - especially if you're using it for a tablet.  For a phone, I would go with another option though.",Verified Purchase,NaN
197,JEM,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect iPad gadget.,"  This ""Amazon Basic"" is surprisingly simple in design, yet precisely what is needed - and nothing more. What I mean is that it is nearly perfect in form and function, especially for anyone who travels. By the look of the stand I was concerned that the stand would easily slip out of position or worse, my iPad would fall off the stand if I touched the screen. Not at all - this stand firmly supports your tablet in either portrait or landscape position, with a confident grip that is uncanny. I happen to have an iPad, but it will work equally well for any tablet. Just spread the base fully open and click the backrest into your favorite position, which can be precisely recalled using small marks that are molded into the plastic at the pivot points of both the upper arm and lower arm. I have applied a bit of white nail polish to the two marks that correspond to my favorite angle. This way I can open up the stand and click it into the perfect position is under two seconds.The base of the stand is notched, which is where the tablet sits. The notch and the upper arm against which the iPad rests are both padded in a foam. The foam protects the tablet from scuffs, but also provides an amazing grip to the tablet. In fact, I can grab the back of the stand, right where the upper arm bends, and carry around my iPad with it resting on the stand. It's nutty! The foam gives it the stick, but the arms are also constructed in such a way that they firmly click into fixed position, so I am never concerned the arms will slip out of position or collapse - even walking around with my iPad sitting on it. I am impressed that such an inexpensive product can be so well designed. Love this little thing.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
198,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect accessory,"  This is an amazing gadget.  I can't believe I lived without it till now.  It works for my Paperwhite, my Galaxy 10 tablet, and my iPad.  It folds up easily and fits in my jeans pocket so it can go out to dinner with me.  Was worried at first it might break, but it is very durable and the stiffness of a new product has dissipated.  Totally adjustable so I can have different angles for different uses.  I frequently cook using my tablets, and I want them at a different angle than I need my Paperwhite for reading.  I just wish I had invented this.  From the reviewsl I thought it would be different from the Arkon, which I also ordered.  Except for the Amazon Basics logo it seems identical.  Perfect, since my husband was really wanting one too.

It is also very easy to adjust, so if we want to use the tablet together, we can adjust it so I can see the screen.  My daughter loves playing the motion (camera) activated games, and this allows her to do so with very good results, since she can adjust it so that the camera can see her, and she can have a good angle to see the screen.

I used tape to keep the padding intact for now.  For $8.95 this is expected. I will probably order another one in the future when my current stand falls apart.

I got real tired of holding my tablet with one hand and eating with the other, and decided to do something about it. After doing some research, I settled on this stand as the one that seemed to meet my needs and be the most value for the dollar. I was right. Folded up, it is small enough to slip into a back pocket (but take it out before sitting down!), and folds out easily when needed. I can set just the right angle for reading, and the joints are stiff enough they are not going to be changed by an accidental bump. I now can enjoy my meals as I should without having to set my tablet down from time to time when both hands are needed. This is definitely a keeper.",Verified Purchase,NaN
211,reesah mouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the iPad (big or small) and for the Kindle,"  I bought this to use with my iPad Mini, because the Smart Cover for the Mini is not very stable when in the upright position, but I actually use it most for my iPad 3 instead. I have a Smart Cover for the big iPad (as well as a back cover), but I like the stability of this stand. When I want my iPad upright on my desk or on the kitchen table or any other stable, flat surface,* this stand allows me to have my iPad at the exact angle that's best for viewing and touching and not seeing glare on the screen. This stand works perfectly with the iPad 3, but I've also used it with the iPad Mini (which I have in aÂ Speck Products FitFolio Protective Cover for iPad mini - FreshBloom Coral Pink (SPK-A1523)  ) and with my Kindle Paperwhite (which I have inÂ Marware jurni Kindle Case Cover, Blue (fits Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle, and Kindle Touch)  ). All three fit on this stand without removing them from their cases. The Kindle rests maybe a bit less stable in this stand without removing it from the case, but it works.I highly recommend this stand even if you have a Smart Cover or another cover that can be used as a stand.*When using my iPad on a surface that is not flat, I often useÂ Peeramid Bookrest Pillow- Red  Â (mine is blue).",Verified Purchase,NaN

When I picked it up, it ripped a foam layer off that was - oh myyy - stick to the counter!I had to get a razor blade to scrape it off. The foam bottom things are great for not scratching a surface, but I totally did not expect that it would meld itself into the counter. It was not super hot, either, because the tablet would have been damaged as well had it gotten really hot, so I don't know why it did that. There was nothing else on the counter (no detergents), either. I use it everywhere I read the tablet, so who knows what caused it. The foam does help on an uneven/bumpy surface, but thick felt might be a better choice.",Verified Purchase,NaN

Show Mode only displays an orientation that assumes switches are on the right.  Lame development decision.

217,Antony P,5.0 out of 5 stars,ONE MAJOR DESIGN Flaw (update),"  Small, sturdy, holds the Ipad pro 12.9 inch ok. There is wobble if you press on it so this wouldn't be good for a drawing stand.The major DESIGN FLAW is the angle at which the feet cradles are cut. The iPad's point of contact is very very small even though it could be about a half an inch. Essentially the grooves are not parallel with the backrest. If this was fixed it would lead to greater longevity and tablet stability, I don't know how they missed this.UPDATE: WITH A LITTLE EFFORT THE FEET OPEN WIDER. I THOUGHT IT WAS BREAKING BUT NOPE!

218,Jill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clever and well made,"  This stand does just what it is advertised as.  You can put your iPad or Kindle type device vertically or horizontally and adjust it to virtually any incline you want.  I've used it for several months now and it is working great - not loosening up like other stands I have.  The quality is very nice. The rubbery pieces in the indents on the bottom legs hold the device steady and you can poke away at the screen without the device falling over.  I also like that it folds up small enough and is light enough to fit in even a small case.I use this in the kitchen as a 'book stand' to see my recipes, or watch a youtube video.  It can also be used with a bluetooth keyboard to hold your screen at an optimal angle.",Verified Purchase,NaN

223,Wiley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost perfect, almost.  With my tablet, this stand has a problem that requires a minor compromise.","  Well, this stand is certainly worth every penny I paid for it.  The construction and ease of use is great for the most part.  However, with a 10.5"" tablet, it seems to not quite adjust to the right angle in either horizontal or vertical orientation.  Note the picture that illustrates the product in use.  That is the problem!  It wants to support the device when it is laying way back.  The back support does not accurately support the back until it gets to that angle.  I elected to hold on to the stand after I discovered I could live with the support articulation issue.  What I wanted from the stand was for it to securely hold the device in a more upright orientation, thereby reducing overhead lighting reflection.  I can use this stand as is, but if I had been able to try it out first, I probably would have kept shopping.  Thankfully, the cost of the stand is a good incentive to buy before you try.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I have also used the stand for a Zoom meeting, for which you need a vertical screen.  The stand lets you get your screen almost vertical, unlike my more expensive brand.

However, the stand that comes with the monitor takes a lot of space and doesnâ€™t provide you with many options to angle the monitor. I then decided to look for another stand and noticed that this tablet stand was often paired with the monitor.Iâ€™ll admit that I was a bit skeptical given the sticker price of $9.79 (tax included) but thought it wouldnâ€™t be a huge loss if the product is defective. I am very pleased to say that I was entirely wrong about this product; the value proposition on this item is huge.First, the compact design makes this stand not only easy to carry in a backpack or laptop bag but also small enough to carry in your pocket. Second, this stand is versatile which you can use for a monitor, laptop, or cell phone for quick and easy use or view pleasure (I like to watch anime while I cook).For ~$10 this product is worth every cent and I definitely recommend that you considering purchasing this item if you need a small stand.Attached are some pictures to help you with your decision.",Verified Purchase,NaN

It fits perfectly into the stand and is easy to get to. I wish the Kindle's power was in a different place, but that has nothing to do with the stand. It's sturdy, easy to set up, takes multiple gadget sizes, and if the Kindle's power adapter sat on the other side of the controls the Kindle would be perfect for it.",Verified Purchase,NaN

270,C. Tourtelot,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great iPad stand!,"  I needed a new iPad stand so I thought Iâ€™d give this one a try. Itâ€™s very inexpensive so if I didnâ€™t like it, no big deal.  I have found it to be perfect for my needs. The angle is adjustable. It folds up when not being used. My iPad is in a full case & still fits nicely on stand horizontally or vertically.

271,Rishathra,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for large tablets,"  It works fine with my 10"" Kindle Fire, but with my 12.9"" iPad it doesn't even pretend to hold it, just collapses immediately.Otherwise it works as advertised. Well thought out and constructed. The packaging would have to be a toy for gorillas before it got damaged. Folds up into a nice, compact package that is easy to carry and/or store.Bottom line, if you have a small to medium size tablet this will work perfectly for you.",Verified Purchase,NaN
272,Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Itâ€™s the okayist stand,"  This stand is functional.  The legs on mine are slightly unstable.  I had to move my device a little to counterbalance the wobbly legs to keep the stand stable.  The adjustment detents for the legs seem likely to wear overtime.  If you are going to â€œset it and forget itâ€ Iâ€™m sure it will be fine, but if you intent to fold the stand up repeatedly after use Iâ€™d consider a sturdier more expensive stand.",Verified Purchase,NaN
273,Harry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good stand, some minor flaws","  It's a good stand for tablets and even fablets. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the foam-like material used for cushioning. Over time it gets ""eaten up"" or separates from the glue. Maybe some kind of soft rubber should be used for a better durability.",Verified Purchase,NaN
274,Adam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well enough for tablets,"  I have been doing a lot of WebEx, Zoom, and FaceTime these days.

275,Tristan Ziegler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for the Amazon Kids Kindles!!,"  I bought my niece and nephew each a Kids Kindle for Christmas.  After watching them try to prop their Kindles up onto water bottles, bowls and anything else that would hold them up, I went on an Amazon search for tablet stands for them.  It was hard to find one with a â€œlipâ€ large enough to hold the Kids Kindle in the big protective cases that they come in, but this stand did the job perfectly.  No more spilled cups, no more propping up the tablets on random household items.  I 100% recommend these for use with the Kids Kindles.",Verified Purchase,NaN

But as a stand to use with my keyboard it is not stable enough to press on - i think i press a bit excitedly. It is just too light to hit the upper corners of the screen with one finger without being very careful. I konw most people won't use it this way. Coincidently i got a fotopro tripod with super flexible legs and i can bend them into a stand which is sturdy. So i'm going to use that instead.",Verified Purchase,NaN

282,James M. Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,works with my Nexus 7 and its portfolio case,"  My Nexus 7 is in a leather portfolio case. Most of the desk stands require you to use a bare tablet;.the notches at the feet won't accommodate the extra thickness of an open portfolio cover. This one does work better than most in that regard. It also works equally well whether the tablet is in vertical or horizontal mode, and has enough space under the tablet  to accommodate a bottom USB connection.Why didn't I give it 5 stars? It is a bit funky to adjust and therefore better suited to a fixed location than for travel where you will be setting it up and storing it frequently. And funky aside, frankly I don't trust all the plastic friction joints to stand up to day in and day out repeated adjustments. Still it is inexpensive enough to justify periodic replacement should my fears come true.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I popped off the factory stand, and bought this little folding one.  You can tell it isn't intended for a tablet this large and heavy, but if you get the vertical section adjusted just right, it works pretty good.  The stand will rock a little if you press too hard on the power button, but that is minor.  A great, very portable little stand, for less than 10 bucks, and it came in the best packaging I have ever seen.",Verified Purchase,NaN

308,catmamabritishstoryreader,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works.,"  This does work for my Nook.  It is sturdy and it is adjustable to hold something wider.

309,Mike Newman,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works well but...,"  This stand works well with larger tablets, somewhere around the 10 inch size.  However, when you take a 7 inch tablet and put in on the stand in ""portrait"" it is easier to tip over.  I wouldn't say it's easy to tip over... but it isn't difficult to do either.  It is easy to tip if the tablet is in a case with a flap that folds behind it, like mine.  I got this to use with my Nexus 7 and I --hated-- this stand until Google updated the tablet so that the home screen could rotate to landscape.  A 7-inch tablet in landscape works great, even with a case like mine.So I would say if you have a 10 inch tablet, your good.  If you have a 7 inch tablet and the home screen rotates to allow landscape, your good.  If you have a thick case, a case with fold behind flap, or you want to use your 7 inch tablet in portrait, you may have trouble.Overall for the price, it works well.  It has grippy foam feet and pads that work well.  It is super simple and folds down small for travel.",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful

323,Gadget Guru,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price - perfect function.,"  This little stand works great for tablets without a built in kickstand, and even for those with a kickstand when you want to hold the tablet vertically.I have a lot of digital manuals and instruction guides on my tablet, so it's nice to have the tablet standing upright where I can read it without having to touch it with messy hands during car repairs and hobby projects. It's also nice to be able to read while I eat my breakfast in the morning without having to crane my neck to see something laying flat on the table.The stand seems to work a bit better with 10"" tablets than 7"" ones, but it held my 7"" Fire without much fuss.

When they arrived, even the packaging was Apple-esque! The device is very cleverly designed. It folds beautifully, for transportation. Then when you open it up, it adjusts for a variety of different devices. It was probably not intended for shortwave radios, but because of it's superb design and manufacture, it adapts perfectly!

343,JimmyMac,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great idea, cheap price.",  I love this will buy another for my wife. It makes the iPad usable turned portrait.

Good for any tablet.,Verified Purchase,NaN
344,R. Siddiqui,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Value Stand that Every iPad Owner should have,"  This small device made me fall in love with my iPad all over again. Who knew something so cheap, could be so useful, and essential to the optimal iPad experience.It's light, compact, folds down, and is easy to travel with. It doesn't just hold up your iPad, but it gives you the freedom to adjust to virtually any angle.No more propping up my iPad against random items around the house, hoping it will stay put. This is a great value item, and it will likely prove useful for every iteration of iPad.Most iPad stands are over priced, too large, too small, too flimsy, and/or have a limited range of motion, in terms of what angles you can adjust to. But this simple, yet effective device, is unobtrusive and scores high marks in all these categories (price, functionality, versatility, and efficiency). It's just right in virtually every way.I bought two stands (one for my 3rd generation iPad w/ Retina display, and one for my 3 year old son's 1st generation iPad) we both love them.",Verified Purchase,NaN

I didnâ€™t like the stands provided on site, as they had keyboards attached and couldnâ€™t angle.

348,Catherine,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT!,"  I absolutely LOVE this!  It folds up so nicely and is easy to take along. My husband recently had back surgery and was told NOT to look down at his iPad, so he uses this instead on a table to keep his head held up.  His physical therapist told him of all the problems they anticipate with people constantly holding their head down to read iPads, iPhones, Kindles, etc.  It puts too much pressure on the neck and spine.I use this on planes.  Don't want to sit and hold my Kindle for hours and hours, (at home I prop my Kindle agains my Beanie Baby, but find it too bulky to take along). The plane tables are pretty funky, so I just put this on an let it do the work.  Recommend it highly.",Verified Purchase,NaN

351,Advocate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Handy!,  I use it all the time for my iPhone and iPad.  The first time you open the arms that form the bottom of the stand they can be a bit sticky.  Don't be concerned about giving a good tug to pull them apart.  Totally recommend.,Verified Purchase,NaN

I am sitting on my bed with a laptop desk, and my KFHD is resting on the stand, and it is not slipping or moving around on the I first opened the box, I was quite pleased on how secured my item was packaged,but the stan seemed a little stiff and I was not sure if I use a little pressure it would break.

355,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a pretty nice little stand,  This is a pretty nice little stand. It has padded areas so your tablet will fit comfortable and it has a sticky bottom so it does not slide. However it is not very versatile for different angles or set up. The arms move in stages not free move so it can only go certain ways. Other wise its pretty nice.,Verified Purchase,NaN
356,Run4Fun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stand works great with Fire,"  This stand is quite flexible and would work well with most any tablet.  I am using it with a Fire HD8 enclosed in a MoKo case.  The stand would be fine with thicker cases and/or different sized tablets.  I do not adjust it much at all, but use it in both vertical and horizontal orientation without changing it.  For travel it folds up to a very compact size.  Well done.",Verified Purchase,NaN

358,Greg O.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works with my iPad in a case.,  I got this as a stand for an iPad being used for remote learning.

359,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Ten Star Adjustable Tablet Stand by Amazon Basics,"  This adjustable tablet stand holds my Kindle Fire both upright and horizontally.  Now.  All my uses are comfortable and manageable.  I also have an android phone, 3x6"" size and it sits well on this adjustable stand.  The stand is easy to adjust.  I am so happy to have this for both devices.  I ordered a second one from another seller but very similar, and I'm looking forward to trying it out.  In addition, this adjustable stand will travel in my purse/bag/briefcase and I can take it out if I'm using my device at lunch and want to read, or watch video and have my hands free.  This is a 10 star device - because it has maximized the use of my devices: Kindle Fire and the Android Phone.  Very happy!",Verified Purchase,NaN
360,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very stable and adaptable.,"  Works well for Kindle Oasis with case.  Large gripping rubber pads on all surfaces and very adjustable.

361,PK,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overly Large and Bulky Stand,  Was hoping to get a small stand I could travel with for tablets and similar. This stand is much bigger than I realized. overkill for what it needs to hold. I wish I read the dimensions. In my mind this was 1/4th the size. However it really could be that small and accomplish the same. Not sure why it's so large.,Verified Purchase,NaN
362,Crystal Rector,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple and functional,"  This is a simple product designed to do exactly what I needed, to stand so I can watch while cooking.

365,Mgoro,5.0 out of 5 stars,For my ipad,"  I really like it. Itâ€™s very simple and I feel confident in putting my ipad on it, without the fear that it will fall down.

369,Bryan Pearson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This works great for portrait or landscape, but keep it dry - the base grips are foam.","  Works great.  The positions on the three joints are determined by small teeth and detente nubs that click past each tooth.  It works well, but I guess that would be the thing likely to wear out someday, if you open and close it a lot.  I liked that they put some foam grip on the top part against which the back of your device will rest.  I wish the foam grip on the base was rubber instead, in case of spills, or to keep it from rolling up when attempting to slide the stand rather than picking it up to move it.I like it very much.  It makes choosing an angle easier and is much steadier than simply propping my device against some other object.",Verified Purchase,NaN
370,Todd Clan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light and Versatile,"  This is a wonderful little item. We bought three, one for each of us, and they all get used. My son uses his at the table and during his weekly trips to the clinic for infusions to set his phone on and watch videos; I use mine at my bedside to turn my phone into an alarm clock, and my wife uses hers to balance her tablet or phone while reading or browsing. It's adjustable so it easily accommodates devices of various sizes and it is light and small and easy to pack into a purse or messenger bag or even into your cargo pants pocket. It's sturdy and you don't have to worry about it collapsing, as it locks into place firmly until you adjust or close it. Highly recommended.",Verified Purchase,NaN
371,R. A. Mungal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the table,  I got tired of using large books to prop up the iPad...this is perfect for the table or a flat sturdy surface.

375,EM,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It honestly feels sturdy, yet a bit cheap","  The price is unbeatable, and it does what it is supposed to. It honestly feels sturdy, yet a bit cheap. It has anti-sliding material at the bottom where it stands, as well as the surface where the tablet rests back and the indents where the tablet stands still. However, the anti-slide at the bottom could be better placed, since it makes it ever so slightly taller where that stuff is, but at the very back there's no rubbery thing, meaning once you put your tablet on the thing will wiggle a bit to the sides since the weight of your device will push the structure backwards where there's no rubber feet (see pics)... But your device won't fall, at least mine hasn't.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
376,Joe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great addition to my tablet accessories,"  For the price this stand is great and very easy to travel with and store in your laptop bag.

378,Jonathan Jarvis,5.0 out of 5 stars,The very same model as the Arkon stand,"  I happened to order one each of the Amazon Basics and the Arkon. stands. Comparing them, they are exactly the same, including the same embossed model number made in Taiwan, except that the Amazon Basics stand has a nice Amazon logo printed on it and comes in a cardboard box, whereas the Arkon stand comes in a plastic envelope. The Amazon model is one dollar cheaper. Either stand does an excellent job of supporting a Nexus 7 tablet while I type on a Bluetooth keyboard. I still prefer a laptop for editing text, however, but the stand makes text entry feasible with a tablet when a laptop is not available.",Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

381,David Tsai,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid stand, slight flaws","  This is a decent stand for the price. It is fairly stable, and has good feet. Unlike other stands, I like how this one lets me adjust the angle of my tablet.I usually keep it on my desk and use the movable arm as a wire management tool, since there is quite a bit of space between the tablet and the arm. I tucked cables into this space and wrapped the power cord for my tablet around the arm.However, this product still has a few flaws. The legs on this stand were incredibly tight, and opening made me feel like something was going to snap (fortunately, nothing did). This stiffness may have been acceptable if it were in another place on the product, which brings me to my next point. The supporting arm is a little loose for my liking. It holds up my Nexus 10 fine in landscape and portrait, but the arm has a very slight give to it when using the tablet while it is in the stand. This definitely isn't deal-breaking, but you should be aware of this. Finally, the pads underneath the tablet sometimes unstick themselves from the legs. So far, I've been able to press them back on to the legs and have them stay stuck for a while, but this is definitely an issue that AmazonBasics should investigate.",Verified Purchase,NaN
382,JaneG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect For Propping up iPad or Tablet on Your Bed!,  I bought this stand so I could prop up my iPad in bed-ON my bed. Itâ€™s perfect. It doesnâ€™t even have to sit on a hard surface. Iâ€™m delighted!,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
383,TexicanTop Contributor: Golf,5.0 out of 5 stars,Portable fold up travel stand.,"  This a great stand. It has an articulating functionality which allows for many different positions and uses. The cutout in the legs are big enough to hold my iPad in a Defender by Otterbox nicely.  It folds up quickly and easily and stores nicely in my backpack by my iPad. The Defender case with stand holds my iPad in very limited positions including a typing position where the Amazon stand does not, so they actually compliment each other. The stand is a good quality. I have had it for a couple of months with pretty heavy usage. It has stood up well except for the cushion pads adhered in the leg cut outs. They are beginning to wear and peel off.  I can easily replace those with mounting tape but if I don't, it will not affect the performance of the stand.

Functionally, I think this stand is one of the best, and it has a decent range of adjustability. The only thing I donâ€™t like about it is that itâ€™s pretty ugly.

390,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this stand!,  This stand is just perfect for holding my Kindle Fire.  I have a case that will hold it horizontally just fine but not vertically.  I like to read at the table while eating and this stand works great.  I like the way it folds up so compactly.  It is very adjustable for many viewing angles and for whatever tablet or reader you might have.  I love the rubber anti skid on the bottom so the stand doesn't slide when I am touching the screen on my Kindle.  It is very sturdy and doesn't tip easily.  Now I wish someone could find a way to incorporate something like this into a slim case!!  I am sure that ingenious person is already working on this so I will keep my eyes open. I bought the slim travel stand and it works well-if I take my Kindle out of it's case. That is too much of a pain.  THIS stand works with my case still on.,Verified Purchase,NaN

I use this at work to hold my Amazon tablet ( 7 inches ) or Samsung tab ( 10 inches ) and it gets the job done on both.This folds up so that you can easily fit in your desk, or bag to transport back and forth. It also can easily adjust so you can put your tablet straight upright, or sideways. It has little divets in the front so that your tablet kind of fits into the groove and is nice and sturdy while in the stand.If you have a big phone you could easily have this stand hold your phone as well, but I just use mine for the tablets.Thank you Amazon Basics for making another great affordable product.",Verified Purchase,NaN

I use one on my desk as a place for my tablet to sit when charging and another I keep in my bag for when I'm out. These stands are light-weight, flexible and portable. They work well with most devices over 5"" diagonal. I have used it for my Galaxy S5, but it isn't very stable for such a small device. My various tablets over time (ranging from 7"" to 10.1"") have all been well accommodated on these stands.

The price was pretty cheap.I thought this was fairly well built. And I've noticed she is still using it fairly frequently. Since she's being using it about 3 months with no problems I would say that validates it being well built. She has told me it needs to sit on a table or some other stable object. I guess she thought she would be able to hold it or use on a soft surface like our bed.She rated it 7.5 to 8.0 - she said it serves it's purpose but she was slightly disappointed in it.,Verified Purchase,NaN

410,LJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"good design, low quality?","  I think the design is more useful in more occasions than other more expensive ones. The price was reasonable but I have a serious concern about the quality. When I first opened the box and tried to open the bottom two legs, the gear that controls how wide the two legs should be is kind of low quality. I feel if I open and close the legs often, it will not last. It is not expensive but I don't think we should compromise on quality. Perhaps my piece is slightly defected but I don't wanna bother shipping it back and get a replacement. I will just deal with it.",Verified Purchase,NaN

We bought one for ourselves and quickly gave them as a gift to our respective parents (in part to maintain our visual sanity).  It allows us to adjust to the different physical characteristics of each device and also allows the stand to be adjusted in many ways so the camera on the device can be angled correctly for FaceTime purposes.

Aside from that it is awesome you can adjust it to just about any position you want your tablet to be in and it hold the tablet very well with no movement when typing or even when pressing the power button when the tablet is almost vertical in the stand.

The disadvantage is when you want to charge your tablet at the same time as reading from it when placed vertically, because the charging cable doesn't fit underneath the tablet.

432,Joe B,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it!,  Ok so I have an iPad Air but it is encased in a 'Survivor' series hard case. Finding a stand that can support the size &  weight of the case is challenging. What's even more challenging is that it does that while standing upright 'portrait'. With the case I have most of the time it will either not fit or slip out of the other stands I have so I have to pull it from the case..This stand does it and does it well. It doesn't move or shift if you use it on the stand. My case size is not a problem with this stand.. I like how I'm able to adjust the stand and I like how it folds up neatly. Basically for the price I challenge you to find anything better.,Verified Purchase,NaN

436,SomethingAwesome,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.,  I don't like those little flappy/fold-y cases everyone has. I love how this one makes possible a whole range of viewing angles and using my iPad vertically or horizontally. I also LOVE how this folds up - it's so small and unobtrusive that it's perfect for traveling (and guest rooms that don't have tvs!). It's also low-profile enough that I can use it as a stand when I want to display my iPad like a digital picture frame.I did subtract one star because it gets sticky sometimes and gives me a hard time getting all the angles I want.,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

478,Kathy T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fits the nexus 7 (2013) model nicely. Differently viewing angles. Folds up nice and small. Just buy this already.,"  I bought this as a stand for my nexus 7. With the proper adjustments it fits it perfectly vertically and horizontally. You can also tip it forwards or backwards for different viewing angles. It does grab the tablet firmly so it shouldn't slide around unless you have it on your belly and are moving it around perhaps, it also has grippers on the bottom so it won't be sliding around on the desk. When you are done it folds up nice and tiny for storage. Only thing it is missing is a nice little case so it doesn't get scratches.",Verified Purchase,NaN

I can't forget to mention the fact that this IS NOT one of those cheaply made contraptions that slowly close up on itself over time causing you to constantly fumble with it and your tablet!

488,Jaime M. Martinez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product,"  Originally I was looking for a case/stand combo but already had a sleeve for my 1st gen Kindle Fire so when I came across this product I was excited because it was exactly what I needed. I have used this stand on two flights so far and only in landscape mode for watching movies but so far I love it.  It is very sturdy in landscape mode and it will fit many sized tablets.  The soft pads on the bottom and where the tablet contacts the stand helps to prevent any type of sliding.  This was put to the test on quite a bumpy flight and the stand/Kindle stayed in it's place without any problems.Pros:- Sturdy construction- Very stable- Fits many sized tablets- Works in portrait and landscape modeCons:- Slightly bulkier than i had hoped when folded up, but worth it since it is so sturdy and can fit small and large tabletsOverall, I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has a Kindle, Android Tablet, or iPad and plans to travel with it or wants to be able to use it at a table without having to hold the device at all times.",Verified Purchase,NaN

We download Prime kids shows to our Kindle Fire when traveling.  In the past, we'd place the Kindle upright on our console and prop it with a tissue box or purse.  Any abrupt stops or sharp turns would send it teetering.  When I happened across this item, its size, design, and rubber feet seemed to fit our needs.  I'm happy to say it did.  We recently traveled five hours in the van, and though the kids didn't watch shows on it the entire time, it did remain upright and in position without fail.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.",Verified Purchase,NaN

You can hold your Kindle Fire HD 7, which is what I used it for, in landscape or in portrait. But when standing straight up, it's very unstable and can be pushed over if you planned on doing anything other than just using it to watch videos.That said, it accomplishes what it set out to do and at the end of the day, that's what I care about.My fiancee' sets it up on her vanity and watches makeup instructional videos while doing her makeup.

Folds up and fits in my purse for long car trips and unfolded it fits both my kindle 4 & my iPad in their cases. No hassle. I just wish it had a sleeve for storage. I worry that I'm gonna ruin it. But then I stop and think... I only spent $10 on this. I can alway get a new one if needed. I did notice that it is a little hard to unfold it, but that is actually ok as it means that it won't close on me by itself. A suggestion would be to make them in different colors for those that like their accessories to match. It is actually one of those few items that is perfect as it is.",Verified Purchase,NaN

I highly recommend it.",Verified Purchase,NaN
528,Scal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient portable stand for travel,"  Nifty little folding stand with good adjustments for a wide range of angles.  Accommodates a large variety of devices and is fairly stable in both portrait and landscape modes with only a tiny bit of wobble.  Haven't used long term so can't comment on durability but it seems to be pretty tough plastic and the hinges seem beefy.  In terms of portability, yes it does fold into a 7"" x 1"" x 1"" stick but it could probably be slimmed down even further with slightly less thick arms.  Overall pleased with purchase.",Verified Purchase,NaN

Perfect!The only slight negative is that the ""teeth"" that help the legs click into each position can wear down over time, so after a couple years they become sort of loose. And the foam that cushions the iPad does wear away. But these issues don't really effect the stability of the stand (somehow), so it's no big deal!Great buy overall.",Verified Purchase,NaN

It's so nice not messing with cables and plugs; I just hope the price comes down and the technology is standardized so I know my chargers will have some longevity.The other is used in the kitchen when we use the tablet for cooking and recipes.Very handy.

534,Mail order fan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well made,"  This was money well spent: this stand can be positioned any way you would like, without interfering with controls. In addition it has a non-skid surface that prevents the device from sliding around in the stand. The bottom has a similar coating so the stand itself also stays firmly in place ,which is a problem with other stands, even if they do the multi-positioning well). It is sturdy and although I have not had any reason to do this yet, I would happily stick it in my disorganized purse without worrying about damaging it.Update - I had to take this down one star because the little rubber pads on the ""leg"" section let loose within a fairly short period of time. Still very happy with it though",Verified Purchase,NaN

I dunno if ""ironic"" is the right word, but that's kinda how I meant to use the word ""sick."" Anyway, I'm getting away from the fact that this is a super cheap, useful stand.

The stand elegantly holds my Surface--and, by placing the ""top"" (power-button side) on the left, I can easily charge the device and have clear access to the USB port. (For a Surface Pro or Surface Pro 2, putting the ""top"" on the right permits both charging (on the [now] bottom) and use of the USB port [on top].)And because the stand quickly and securely folds, I can haul it between home and work or toss it into my suitcase for travel.",Verified Purchase,NaN

562,saatvik dube,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not use with large tablets,"  If you have a small lightweight tablet this might work fine, but trying to use it for a wacom pen tablet, which is a fairly heavy device, is nearly impossible. The stand itself is small, light, and not very stable, so any pressure on the top left or right corners of you screen can cause the entire tablet to fall off the stand.

566,Matt Sweeney,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product that I feel will break eventually,"  I love this thing. It's supremely adjustable, doesn't slip, and feels solid. So why the three-star review? Because of the way you open and close the thing--it has these gear-like mechanisms that just rub against each other. Every time I open or close it, I feel like I could easily break it. I wish I could describe the problem better, but it's a case of ""this much force will open the thing, slightly more feels like it will break it and render it useless."" But, you can't really adjust how much force you use. You have to use enough to open it, right? But the force needed to open it feels like it will break it eventually.Sorry, this feels like the lamest review I've ever written.",Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful

I appreciate the rubber treatment on the bottom and some other spots that help the stand and the Kindle stay where they're put. I have even been able to connect the charger while the Kindle is in the stand. I think, no matter what stand one gets, you always have to be a bit careful not to push too hard on your tablet/e-reader to make sure it doesn't accidentally tip it and the stand over.

632,garie,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Decent Cheap Solution,"  This is an okay product for its price. The design is kind of ugly (sorry Amazon!) and the plastic is cheap, but it serves its purpose. What I don't like is that there isn't a way for the holder to *grab* onto the tablet. If I push the stand arm to position my tablet at a 90 degree angle, any sudden movement will cause my tablet to fall over. It isn't easy to move both the tablet and stand at once. These issues sound nitpicky, but good design keeps these things in consideration. The design on this does not do that.",Verified Purchase,NaN

The stand has two settings to adjust the spread of the legs for stability, but the wider setting is too wide to hold the Kindle. Setting the Kindle in the ""landscape"" position resolves this issue, but you have to get used to using the page-turn buttons in a different orientation.

It also has little black sticky felt like stuff on the bottom grooves that's suppose to help it not slip out of place, but it always coming off. Not sure why they do such a bad design with the bottom stickers. I'm gonna have to try and find something similar to help keep my iPad from slipping. The grooves are not deep and with out the sticky felt stuff it would just slip out and could cause damage.

819,Louis L.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Portable and works well,"  I use this with both an iPad and a Kindle at home, office, and when traveling.  It works as a stand to make it easier to read as a reference or for pleasure.  When I use my iPad with a keyboard, it is more stable a stand than the cover I have or the stand that is attached to my keyboard.  It is even stable enough to use in bed.  The only quibble is that there is one most stable angle and I could like more flexibility, but the advantage of low cost and portability (whereever I put my iPad, it usually fits in the space right next to it) makes it hard to complain about it.",Verified Purchase,NaN

831,reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,EXACTLY THE SAME AS ARKON FOLD UP STAND,"  I bought this fold up stand as well as an Arkon stand  that they are selling here on Amazon. They are EXACTLY THE SAME except one says Amazon and the other one says Arkon. Both black, both have the same patent number on the bottom and both say Taiwan. I paid $8.99 for Amazon stand and $12.99 for Arkon stand. The ""upper arm"" that goes behind your device has foam pads for traction and protection. The two ""legs"" have foam grips on the bottom  for traction and protects surfaces too. The distance between the notches when ""legs"" are opened all the way is approximately 3 1/2 -4 inches. The notches on the ""legs"" hold the bottom of your device and also has foam pads where the bottom front of your device will sit. Since the cut out only has foam pad on one side,  my tablet was sliding when i use it to read in bed. It should not be an issue if it is on a stable surface but i usually prop the stand on a pillow so it tends to move. I put some electrical tape on the slippery side to stop  it from moving. Seemed to help. The screw that holds the bend on the ""arm"" looks sturdy and holds my galaxy tab 10.1 without any problem so far. I like the product. It seems well made but they need to put pads on both sides of the notches so i dont have to modify it.",Verified Purchase,6 people found this helpful

It is light weight but sturdy enough to hold my Fire safely. I use this in a variety of situations, using it to read while in a coffee shop, restaurant or working at my desk. I can have the Fire at the perfect angle for reading while I eat or when I am working at a desk. It also makes it easier to use the keyboard and for surfing the web as it has many possible positions for just about every situation.As a knitter, it is perfect for holding my Fire while I am knitting. I keep several knitting patterns that I am working on in my Fire and being able to prop it up makes it so much easier to use while knitting. I don't have to put my work down to check the pattern and don't lose my place as easily while using it.I have also used this at work to hold up hard copy while I work at my computer. I use a file folder and clip my copy to it and use the travel stand to hold my copy while I work with it. I often have to condense verbiage to put announcements and notices on my work blog. It is small and folds up so I can put it away when I am not using it. And it's less expensive than most copy holders that are big and bulky and get in the way when space is at a premium.I just love this product and will be purchasing a second one to keep at work.

Large footprint with rubber padding makes for a stable stand where you don't have to worry about the tablet moving when touching the corners of the display.  This stand will last forever.Minus one star just for the size when folded. That wide base that gives excellent stability makes this stand a bit on the large size when collapsed.

1439,M,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"  I'm not impressed with this tablet stand. I usually like the amazon basics brand because they're usually simple to manufacture, no frills items that are really inexpensive.The general function of the stand is really cool but the mechanical action is just a let down. When I first got it I tried to just unfold it but it was so flimsy and rigidly stuck in place I had to check the instructions because I thought I must be doing something wrong because I thought I was going to break it. There was nothing wrong except the way the stand splits open at the bottom. There are these little plastic nubs that hold it in position kind of like gears and they're like 1mm  high and made of cheap plastic. They are visibly scuffed or fused funny and I have opened it maybe 3 or 4 times. They wont last. Also most of the adjustments for the back part that holds the tablet up, do not sit flush with the back of the tablet. It's just kind of a flawed product design. I feel like I'm being harsh but it's true.My advice would be to get something else for a couple bucks more. There's an entire category for laptop stands on amazon and there are tablet stands within it. There are a lot of happy customers of this product so I may have just gotten one that slipped passed quality control. Good luck guys.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

The vee slots on the feet are nowhere near big enough for a tablet in a book-cover style case (such as the Tab S2's official book cover).

2124,Wanderer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very Nice Product For My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1","  This stand is higher quality than I expected.Anyone who has tried to stand up a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1, or equivalent, knows it is difficult.This stand takes that problem out of the equation. It works well, in portrait or landscape mode, is completely adjustable for angle, and even has enough clearance, to plug in the charging cord. It would, and does, work just as well with other sizes, like my 7"" Kindle Fire HD.It folds up small, with no sharp corners, and tucks away easily in my small tablet attache.The ratcheting mechanism is  coarse enough, that it should last for a long time. It is also very stable, with no worries about it folding up while in use.This is one, of several, attachments/appliances that you should buy when you make the original purchase of a tablet computer.I highly recommend this product to friends, and you should too.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful

2454,Matt,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So-so stand, not worth $9","  I've been in the market for a tablet stand for a while, and when I saw this one from AmazonBasics and the large number of positive reviews I decided to purchase it the last time I ordered. However, I was quite disappointed at the quality of the stand once I received it. The stand is made of plastic, not metal. It keeps the weight down, and it is a thicker plastic, but it is still plastic. it features anti-slip material on the bottom of the feet and on the underside top half of the arm, but it is foam, not rubber, so durability is an issue, especially if it is taken in and out of bags. it does not have any padding on the tip of the arm, so if you want your tablet sitting more upright than what is shown in the display picture for this tablet, it will be resting against hard plastic. The legs do not spread wider than the display picture shows, so those of us with larger tablets (I have an 11.6"" MSI W30 purchased here on Amazon) may find stability is an issue when used in landscape mode.All in all it's an alright stand, but it's a $4 stand, not the $9 Amazon asks.",Verified Purchase,NaN

3046,Andrew Russell,3.0 out of 5 stars,Flimsy,"  I wasn't as impressed with this stand as I have been with other Amazon Basics items. The construction of the stand itself is fine, but the design is lacking. When used with an iPad, it seems rocky and not secure. Plus, it is hard to find a good enough tilt on the back arm. If it isn't set just right, the iPad will push it backwards when you tap. I think that the problem lies with the pads on the bottom. It lacks a full pad under the hinge on the rear, so of course, the natural tendency is to tilt backwards. That is the opposite of the desired behavior of a stand like this.Overall, it does its job, and it is OK for the price, but I bet that there are much better ones out there.",Verified Purchase,NaN

The iPad isn't going to fall to the side with standard tapping or anything, but I just didn't feel comfortable leaving it on the stand for fear that the table might be bumped and the iPad might fall.  For very little difference in price I much prefer Anker's multi-angle stand. Very substantial in comparison to the AmazonBasics stand. So while this stand does it's job, and therefore doesn't warrant 1 or 2 stars, there are better options available. As always, Amazon was amazing regarding this transaction. I attempted to return the stand and Amazon gave a refund and said go ahead and keep the stand, no need to return it. Saves me a trip to the UPS store.",Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful

4727,Phaeton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very First Letdown by an Amazon Basics Product,"  Amazon Basics products are consistently well-made and efficient. This is the first one that has disappointed me. I needed a stand for a 13"" Azpen (also a disappointment) and this seemed to fit the bill; it does not. It does not sit securely without wobbling. It does manage the weight of the tablet but will not hold a position that keeps it upright enough for clear viewing. I have adjusted it multiple times and have even tried to use it backwards to no avail. I actually feel bad about knocking an Amazon product but I feel that I would not be doing them any favors by not pointing out these flaws.",Verified Purchase,8 people found this helpful

That's exactly the tough I had when I ordered this tablet stand. However, the result of the whimsical purchase was a pleasant surprise. Not only does the stand work well, even for my large 10.5"" Samsung Tab S, I now rely on it every day. It serves as a second screen in my office which streams news or acts as a notepad or runs apps not available on desktops. It acts as my recipe book stand when cooking. It even converts my tablet into a bedside clock radio and info center. Seriously, I've bought mobile and computer accessories at 5x the cost only to use them a hand full of times.

Also, they don't leave enough room at the bottom for a cable to be plugged in while a tablet or large smartphone that has a bottom plug (as many do) is in portrait orientation. This causes the stand to wobble to the left and right.

Here's the point:  It's not whether or not you can get your Gmail contacts into this device.  Yes you can... sort of. Some of my contacts were missing for no reason I could figure out, and I could not import my groups.  Yes I could go to contacts.gmail.com and get my contacts and groups from there, but there's no way to send an email from that location.Here's the bottom line:  I went to Costco and purchased a Galaxy Tab A 9.7 for $40 more than I paid for the Kindle Fire HD 10"".  Boy, what a difference. Syncing up to my existing Gmail stuff, including contacts, was so easy it feels like cheating.  Everything else is easier too.  Do yourself a big favor, spend the extra $40 and get the Samsung.  It's head and shoulders above the Kindle.  Don't get me wrong, I will continue to be a faithful Amazon supporter, and getting a lot of use out of Amazon Prime, but the Kindle simply doesn't cut it.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful
4996,Doris Tan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bulky,  The stand is bulky but it is light  in weight. I find it not the money worth. Especially with the added postage.,Verified Purchase,One person found this helpful
4997,Michael Richards,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best F'ing thing under $10 I have ever bought on Amazon!,"  Best F'ing thing under 10 dollars I have ever bought on Amazon! No, I'm serious. I'd give it a 20 on versatility alone. I got tired of propping up my tablet on a pillow or whatever else was laying around, so I thought for $10, ""let's try this, it looks simple and folds up nice, so it'd be good to go on a trip."" So I get the thing, and it's well built and sturdy, but I didn't really appreciate the engineering until I started to use it. The combination of two hinges and the v-shaped adjustable base means you can come up with a pleasantly bewildering variety of positions you can put this thing in. I modified mine slightly with Velcro to allow it to attach to some other things I have that are Velcro'd. And not only does it seem to fit every situation and position: hanging; standing sideways; upside down; and in the two or three positions I was expecting it to, it turns out that it acts as a cord detangler and small cable management system and can hold two or three different things all at the same time. Seriously the engineering that went into this little thing is amazing. Because somebody calculated all of those angles and how those hinges should work and it is just well done. I usually find engineers over-engineer stuff, and with the exception of bridges, buildings and aircraft, I don't really want them to be involved in most things. But this is an example of engineering done right. So whatever team of engineers, or if possible, a single engineer, designed this gets an ""attaboy"" and then some. I'll buy you a beer if you're ever in Florida. I will probably be buying several more of these to use for other unexpected things. If you're getting ready to order one, go ahead and make it three and see where else you can use it, because it's crazy useful.",,NaN
4998,Bernard Dale,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unsuitable,"  I do not use a stand on a flat surface but being in my 80's, need to use it from a lounge chair with rounded arms. I therefore hoped the supportive section would swivel on the base. Unfortunately it doesn't  so that I cannot use it.",Verified Purchase,2 people found this helpful
4999,Dr. Rick Kirschner,2.0 out of 5 stars,Feels very cheaply made,"  I don't care for this stand at all.  It's okay for a 1st gen iPad, it works in the way it's supposed to do.  But it feels like very cheap plastic junk, and it's fat black back support blocks the beautiful Apple on the back of the iPad.  I much prefer the Belkin Flip Stand.",Verified Purchase,4 people found this helpful
